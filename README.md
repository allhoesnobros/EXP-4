EXP 4: SETS IN PYTHON

THEORY :-

A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are written using curly brackets { } or created using the set() function. Duplicate elements are not allowed in a set.

Sets are mutable, which means elements can be added or removed after creation. However, sets do not support indexing or slicing because they are unordered.

Sets are commonly used to perform mathematical operations such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. They are very useful when working with distinct data like unique roll numbers, IDs, or values.

ALGORITHMS :-

Union and Intersection of Sets
Algorithm:

Start the program.

Create two sets with given elements.

Perform union operation on the sets.

Perform intersection operation on the sets.

Display the results.

Stop the program.

Difference and Symmetric Difference
Algorithm:

Start the program.

Create two sets.

Find the difference between the sets.

Find the symmetric difference between the sets.

Display the output.

Stop the program.

Subset and Superset Check
Algorithm:

Start the program.

Create two sets.

Check whether one set is a subset of the other.

Check whether one set is a superset of the other.

Display the result.

Stop the program.

Demonstration of Frozenset
Algorithm:

Start the program.

Create a list of elements.

Convert the list into a frozenset.

Display the frozenset.

Note that elements cannot be modified.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION

In this experiment, we studied sets in Python and their properties. We learned how to perform set operations like union, intersection, difference, and subset checking. We also understood the use of frozensets. Sets help in handling unique data efficiently and simplify many programming tasks.
